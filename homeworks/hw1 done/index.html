    <li>In this article i learned how to better develop a product/design critic sense by having the habit of going deeper on the purpose of each element in an app or webpage.

    <li>"The placeholder text in the search bar could have just said “Search here” but instead they mention a specific city. Though I have no intention of going to London, seeing the possibility of it is exciting."</li>
